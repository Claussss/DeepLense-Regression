# DeepLense Regression

A FastAI-based tool for performing regression on strong lensing images to predict axion mass density of galaxies.

This is a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2021 / 2022 project.

## Project Description
The goal of the project is to apply deep regression techniques to explore the properties of dark matter. We approximated the mass density of vortex substructure of dark matter condensates on simulated strong lensing images. The images are generated with PyAutoLense.

You can find more information about the project in this [blog post](https://medium.com/@yuriihalyc/gsoc-2021-with-ml4sci-deep-regression-for-exploring-dark-matter-32691c46adfa).

## Installation

Clone the repository and enter the main folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Claussss/DeepLense-Regression.git
cd DeepLense-Regression
```
Next, you need to install **pipenv** unless you already have it installed.
```bush
pip install pipenv
```
Install all the dependencies for the project.
```bash
pipenv install --dev
```
Activate the project's virtualenv.
```bash
pipenv shell
```
## Usage

### Data
The dataset consists of strong lensing images with vortex substructure generated by PyAutoLense. The parameters for the generator were taken from the following paper: [Decoding Dark Matter Substructure without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12731).

The dataset contains *25k* grayscale images with the size of *150x150*. 

Images are stored in a .npy file with the following dimensions: *(250000,1,150,150)*. 

Labels are stored in a separate .npy file and have the following dimensions: *(250000,1)*.

You can find the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NPf7Mui5Qt_vVm5wtlNq17vKnto-Nqkc?usp=sharing).

Create a single .npy file from multiple .npy files where every file contains an image and the correponding mass, 
please run 

```bash
python ./data/preprocess_dataset.py --path_to_images '/path_to_files' 
                --result_path '/result_dir'   
```

### Weights
We trained xResnetHybrid101 on the given dataset with the following parameters:
* batch size=64
* number_of_epochs=120
* lr=1e-2

The weights can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NPf7Mui5Qt_vVm5wtlNq17vKnto-Nqkc?usp=sharing).
### Examples
[Example notebook](https://github.com/Claussss/DeepLense-Regression/blob/main/example_notebook.ipynb)

### Training
The script takes path to images and labels as inputs and outputs trained weights for xResnetHybrid in the output directory. 
```bash
python train.py --path_to_images '/images.npy' 
                --path_to_labels '/labels.npy'
                --output_dir 'output_dir/'
                --batch_size 64
                --num_of_epochs 120
                --lr 1e-2
